> A little text editor that just works

Dinky is a terminal-based text editor designed for people who want to quickly edit text without having to learn the arcane ways of vi, emacs, or other traditional terminal editors. It wraps the excellent editor component from [micro](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro) with a familiar GUI-style interface complete with menus, dialogs, and intuitive navigation.

**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/sedwards2009/dinky

## Why Dinky?

Have you ever found yourself needing to quickly edit a file in the terminal but no wanting to waste brain cells learning another text editor "religion"? Then Dinky is for you! It provides a familiar interface with mouse support, menus, dialogs, scroll bars, and keyboard shortcuts. It all feels natural because you have been working like this on the desktop for years. It is like a desktop editor was squeezed down to fit inside your terminal.

Now you can edit that git commit or random config file in the terminal and then quickly get back to your desktop editor to do "real work". Dinky will even do a cheap cosplay impression of VSCode just to hammer on that sense of familiarity!
